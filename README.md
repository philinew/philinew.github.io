### About me

My research covers topics related to the media, algorithms, and their relation to political and market institutions. Methodologically, I specialize in developing new approaches to quantify politically and economically relevant concepts from unstructured data such as text.

In January 2023, I joined ETH Zurich as a Post-Doctoral researcher, working at the Center for Law & Economics with [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com/). I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/) (summa cum laude, 2023), supervised by [Roland Hodler](https://sites.google.com/view/rolandhodler). I visited the Paris School of Economics in 2021/2022, hosted by [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/). In 2019, I visited ETH Zurich, hosted by Elliott Ash.

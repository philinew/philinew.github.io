### About me

My research covers topics related to the media, algorithms, and their relation to political and market institutions. Methodologically, I specialize in developing new approaches to quantify politically and economically relevant concepts from unstructured data such as text.

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/).

Before, I worked as a Post-Doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich and the University of St.Gallen. I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/) (summa cum laude, 2023), supervised by [Roland Hodler](https://sites.google.com/view/rolandhodler). I visited the Paris School of Economics in 2021 and 2022, hosted by [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/). In 2019, I visited ETH Zurich, hosted by Elliott Ash.

### About me

I'm a Ph.D. student at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/). My research covers topics in political, media, and development economics. I am particularly interested in bringing natural language processing techniques to applied economics research.

My Ph.D. supervisor is [Roland Hodler](https://sites.google.com/view/rolandhodler).

### About me

My research covers topics related to the media, algorithms, and their relation to political and market institutions. Methodologically, I specialize in developing new approaches to quantify politically and economically relevant concepts from unstructured data -- such as text, images, and videos -- and implementing them in open-source software.

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/).

Before, I worked as a Post-Doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich and the University of St.Gallen. I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/) (summa cum laude, 2023), supervised by [Roland Hodler](https://sites.google.com/view/rolandhodler). I visited the Paris School of Economics in 2021 and 2022, hosted by [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/). In 2019, I visited ETH Zurich, hosted by Elliott Ash.

### News


#### MPWZ-CEPR Text-as-Data-Workshop

I co-organize the MPWZ-CEPR Text-as-Data Workshop series with [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com/) and [Sascha O. Becker](http://www.sobecker.de/). The most recent edition took place on 15-16 September. It marked the 10th anniversary of our series and featured special events, including a panel discussion on "AI in Economics Reviewing and Publishing."

The next edition will take place on April 13th-14th, 2026. As always, our conference is online-only -- to bring the latest text-as-data research to anyone, free of cost.
 
Submit papers [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xayw4Flucx1EbjOAoipblrBYHq7bFbFevm8TDLtjmWs/edit) by March 13th, 2026.
